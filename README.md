# explorimmo-service-alertes

Hi

Here some work on Scala I've done, while working on Explorimmo.com website.
I had as mission to manage the different alerts that an user can look for.

Used tools: Doobie API, Scala, ScalaTest, PlayFramework ...


Create new database 'test' in PostgreSQL: 
`create Database test;`

Then you can "test" (small tests) with the line: `sbt test`
