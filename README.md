# explorimmo-service-alertes

Hi

Here some work on Scala I've done, while working on Explorimmo.com website.
My mission was to manage the different alerts that an user can look for, using different tools.

Used tools: Doobie API, Scala, ScalaTest (Mockito), PlayFramework, PostgreSQL ...


Create new database 'test' in PostgreSQL: 
`create Database test;`

Then you can "test" (small tests) with the line: `sbt test`
